# Lance 2d physics test

Test game to integrate [p2.js](https://schteppe.github.io/p2.js/) on a [Lance](http://lance.gg/) project.

Based on a [P2 example](http://schteppe.github.io/p2.js/examples/canvas/character.html)

To simplify the test i transformed the floor to p2.Box ( from p2.Plane ) , so all gameObjects implementations are "boxes" with diferent sizes, color, material, mass.

*Currently is not working properly .
